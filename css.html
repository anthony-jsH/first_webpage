    <a href="index.html" title="main page"> back to main </a>
    <p>
        this is page CSS <br>
        This page is dedicated to CSS experiments <br> 
        <br>
        Here is a cute image of a cat <br>
        It was here because this page was otherwise just a blank canvas, <br>
        but i like this image so I will just leave it here, unharmed.

        <h2> What is CSS for? </h2>
        The css is for making "prettier" webpages. <br>
        Just like "script" tag designates what's inside to be javascript code, <br>
        The "style" tag will tell the browser that what's inside is CSS code. <br>
        Notice how the link to the main page has different color? this is possible because of CSS. <br>
        <!--
            not quite true though, you can also use <font> tag to change color if you want to use only html for some reason,
            but using CSS is a better choice. 
        -->
        So you can make some letters <asdf> larger </asdf> or <aass> in other colors </aass> using CSS.
        You can select some entities using "class" inside the tag. Select using .[class name]<br>
        Also, there is "id" that you can use inside the tag. Select using #[id name]<br>
        note that the id can only be used once.

        <ul>
            <li> <a href="index.html"> these </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="index.html"> lead </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="index.html" class="makered"> to the </a></li>
            <li> <a href="index.html" id="same"> same </a> </li>
            <li> <a href="index.html" class="makered"> link </a> </li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <cutter> </cutter>

    <p>
        see that dotted line above?<br>
        this is made possible by making a tag (whatever name you like, I chose "cutter")<br>
        remember there is a property called display which has several options, block and inline being two among them.        
    
    </p>

    <cutter> </cutter>
