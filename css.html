        this is page CSS <br>
        This page is dedicated to CSS experiments <br> 
        <br>
        Here is a cute image of a cat <br>
        It was here because this page was otherwise just a blank canvas, <br>
        but i like this image so I will just leave it here, unharmed.

        <h2> What is CSS for? </h2>
        The css is for making "prettier" webpages. <br>
        Just like "script" tag designates what's inside to be javascript code, <br>
        The "style" tag will tell the browser that what's inside is CSS code. <br>
        Notice how the link to the main page has different color? this is possible because of CSS. <br>
        <!--
            not quite true though, you can also use <font> tag to change color if you want to use only html for some reason,
            but using CSS is a better choice. 
        -->
